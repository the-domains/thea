# Why Story Structure is Like Songwriting

There's a reason why works of art are often called compositions. They are by definition _composed,_with a certain structure that the creator felt best represented that work. Sometimes this process is unconscious, as when artists compose by instinct, sensing what feels right. Sometimes it is very conscious, as when a painter does multiple studies before they set brush to canvas, or a writer decides to plot a story before they ever sit down to write a word of it.

When it comes to storytelling, instinct vs. intent sometimes manifests as pantsing (writing by the seat of your pants) vs. plotting (planning out the major turning points beforehand). Most writers tend to find a balance that works for them, as neither pantsing nor plotting is a binary state but a spectrum in which every writer is unique. 

Some fall into the camp of the former, citing the spontaneity of undiscovered words as the most enjoyable part of gaining momentum. Some fall into the camp of the latter, preferring not to waste time on setting down words without knowing where they're going. Some fall in between; they might begin with inspiration then get down to the hard work of craft, or put a plan in place only to let inspiration flow within the space between plot points.

Every once in awhile, there is a backlash against one end of the spectrum or the other. Sometimes this backlash doesn't even come from the creators ourselves, but from critics or fans.

Take for example "[Pixar's 22 Rules of Storytelling][0]" (which were neither "rules" nor Pixar's, as it turned out). Story artist [Emma Coats][1] tweeted some tips on storytelling basics that she had gleaned during her time at Pixar. They were collected, went viral, and ravenously devoured by storytellers who appreciated any glimpse into the process of one of the most revered and successful studios in the world.

[The resulting backlash][2] accused Pixar of being (gasp!) formulaic. 

I doubt many people would fault a painter for sketching out their composition beforehand in order to ensure its clarity of message, yet "formula" has such a negative connotation in storytelling. The painter's formulae is considered craft, the storyteller's formulae is considered selling out.
