It has occurred to me that there are primarily two types of storytelling in modern role-playing video games, or RPGs: the open world and the linear narrative.

In the open world, the player is encouraged to build their own story. They uncover and interact with a variety of quests, challenges, and obstacles. There may be a main quest line, but often they don't need to follow it in order to enjoy the game, and indeed many players spend hundreds or even thousands of hours in these worlds and never complete the main quest. Even if they do, the game isn't technically over, and they can continue to play within the world, follow other stories and achieve other goals. _Elder Scrolls, Fable, World of Warcraft, _and _Destiny _fall within this category of open world.

Then there are the more cinematic games. These worlds tend to be smaller and easier to fully explore, with very little real estate wasted on quests that don't support the main storyline. More effort is put into building a rich linear narrative, going deep into detail rather than broad in scope. These games tell a primary narrative through more cut scenes, with fewer deviations in outcome. The player's character may make choices that affect the plot, but the same key events tend to happen in the world, the only changes being how their character reacts to them. When the story is over, it's over, and there's no going back. _Dragon Age, Mass Effect, _and _Diablo_ tend to fall in this category.

Each of these types of RPG use the elements of story in a different way, and craft the experience based on what the player desires. 

Personally, I prefer the cinematic style of play. While I certainly enjoy exploring beautiful worlds, endless options tend to bore and intimidate me. I'm much more interested in being thrust into the center of a dramatic story that is affected by my actions, even if my choices are limited to three selections per conversation branch. I enjoy the feeling of being a part of a sci-fi or fantasy film, which is why Mass Effect is one of my favorite franchises.

On the other hand, gamers like my husband prefer the open world style of play, where there are items to collect, always new places to explore, and something new around every bend in the road.

Which do you prefer, and what do you think these games do well when it comes to storytelling?
